        About my overall skills, WebSFM is my best work.
    </section>

    <section>
        The programming language I'm most fluent is JavaScript, I have been working on WebSFM for a year now. I'm also learning Scala and functional reactive programming.

    <section>
        About traditional programming languages like C++ and Java, I learned and passed it like other CS major, but haven't used them for a while and never did real work with it.

        About Linux:
    </section>

    <section>
        <p>
            I am experienced with Linux, have been using Arch Linux full time for more than 3 years (desktop, server, raspberry pi, etc).
        </p>
        <p>
            Use Arch Linux fulltime is mostly because 3 years ago I want to get into *nix as fast as possible, I heard Arch is one of the more complicated distribution out there,
            so I choose immersive learning by ditch Windows and use Arch fulltime. The result is extraordinary, I not only learned *nix very quick, because of the
        </p>
        <p>
            Using linux is superisingly helpful to deal with China's internet situation (you know...).
            I can easily set up a load balanced TCP proxy using haproxy and socks on my machine, can hold up to 1080p youtube streaming, it's pretty handy.
        </p>
        <p>
            At this moment I'm still using it full time is mostly because I don't have a spare PC and don't want to change my setup before employment.

        About English:
    </section>

    <section>
        I took GRE in the second year of college.
    </section>

    <section>
        By the time being, taking GRE was a pretty big deal for me.
        I wasn't very good at english when I enter college,
        although try to read English tech/math books immediately, still not so good.
        So I signed up for GRE in the second year as a challenge. (As far as I know GRE is the hardest english test avaliable)
        When nailed it, it's a pretty big triumph for me.
        Afterwards, I translated several episodes of 'Louie' in my spare time, can still be found on shooter's database.
        Later on I discovered youtube... Long story short, english is not my problem anymore.
